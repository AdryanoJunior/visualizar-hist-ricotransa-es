# My Cypress Automation

This project uses Cypress to automate testing of a feature to view the user's successful transaction history, and a feature to display a message indicating that the user has no previous transactions.
Cypress is a JavaScript-based end-to-end testing framework that allows developers to write tests and run them in a real browser.

## Installation
```bash
npm install
```
> **NOTE:**
>
> it is necessary to have **node** installed

## Running
```bash
# You open the Cypress UI
npx cypress open

# Run the automation by command line
npx cypress run
```
